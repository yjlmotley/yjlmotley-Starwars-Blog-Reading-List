--- IDEAS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT ON PROJECT ---

* Redo the Not found! page for styling
* Favorite li link (blue when hovering would be nice, with white/black when active)

* Update footer with linked.in link and any other social media/marketing ideas.

* Consider using arrows or a smooth slider instead of the basic scroll slider.
* Make sure scroll to top is working on details pages.
* Consider putting an easily seen go back to Home link text on details tabs.
* Consider adjusting the dropdown menu so it doesn't auto close,
 (stay open until you click out of it, and a top right "x" button would be good too.)

* Card Heart just outlines red when you hover, then completely read when selected into favs.


* Relink the index for the starships as the numbers and the index are off.
Worst case scenario, switch to another topic but try not to.

* Make sure there is a picture for each card/item


* Maybe something in the middle of the page that has a low index/possibly transparent? 
(also going back to home page maybe)
*Maybe try giving the card a stock card texture feeling?

* Maybe add some twinkling stars in the background of the whole pages? 
(keep in mind the layout height is way off)
*(fix layout height issue)

ðŸ˜Ž Feeling Confident?
The following features are not needed for the final solution, but you can develop them if you feel confident enough:

+1 Prevent the website from fetching the Startwars API again if refreshed (you can use the localStorage to save the store on the local browser).
+3 Implement a search bar with autocomplete for characters, planets, and vehicles. When the autocomplete is clicked it should take you to the detailed page of the element.

--- IDEAS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT ON PROJECT ---

* Clear all fav button in the navbar fav dropdown 
* Details styling could be better (check the death star details page)

* Redo the Not found! page for styling
* Favorite li link (blue when hovering would be nice, with white/black when active)

* Update footer with linked.in link and any other social media/marketing ideas.

* Consider using arrows or a smooth slider instead of the basic scroll slider (left and right arrow to scroll instead of using .overflow-scroll)
* Make sure scroll to top is working on details pages (it is going to the top of the details, just not above the navbar)
* Consider putting an easily seen go back to Home link text on details tabs.
* Consider adjusting the dropdown menu so it doesn't auto close,
 (stay open until you click out of it, and a top right "x" button would be good too.)

* Card Heart just outlines red when you hover, then completely read when selected into favs.


* Relink the index for the starships as the numbers and the index are off.
Worst case scenario, switch to another topic but try not to.

* Make sure there is a picture for each card/item


* Maybe something in the middle of the page that has a low index/possibly transparent? 
(also going back to home page maybe)
*Maybe try giving the card a stock card texture feeling?

* Maybe add some twinkling stars in the background of the whole pages? 
(keep in mind the layout height is way off)
*(fix layout height issue)

* Add manual images for the starships or considering using a different pathway

--- WORKING ON.... ---
- [ ] play with the scroll bar and make it more stylish
- [ ] fix the details pages (img): similar format as the Card.js file)
- [ ] fix the footer issue: 
          * make the main div relative and the footer fixed with a padding at the bottom of the pages for the footer
- [ ] delete all favorites option in the bottom of the navbar favorites dropdown button

+3 Implement a search bar with autocomplete for characters, planets, and vehicles. When the autocomplete is clicked it should take you to the detailed page of the element.
